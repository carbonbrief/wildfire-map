Hence boreal forests and tropical forests are identified as sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind speed. Increases in burned area are modelled in these sensitive biomes for the period 2026–2045.",

Increased vegetation cover and density lead to increased burned area in fuel-limited regions.

    "summary":"This study analysed the relation between observed temperature and wild fire activity in Sardinia. It shows a remarkable relation between wildland fires are high temperature. The average size and number of fires as well of occurrence of large fires and area burned were all high on high temperature days. It suggests that fire management could plan more effectively by using the statistics and projections on heat waves and strong winds.",

These two events closely reflect the impact of climate change on conditions that favour wildfires even if the mechanisms were different.",
