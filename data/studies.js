Resulting increased temperature and vapour pressure enhanced fuel aridity over recent decades, accounting for ~55% of observed increases from 1979 to 2015, in western US forests.

Regionally diverse trends are observed, however the suppression of fires in savannahs dominates the global trend due to their significant contribution to global burned area. Burned area trended upwards in forested regions, notably in the boreal zone. The results indicate that direct human suppression of fire countered the effects of climate change on burned area.",

Observed fire patterns suggest that burned area is sensitive to change in FWI below ~17, but insensitive to changes in FWI above this threshold. Hence boreal forests and tropical forests are identified as sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind speed. Increases in burned area are modelled in these sensitive biomes for the period 2026–2045.",

Dangerous fire conditions have increased in likelihood particularly in spring and early summer. The study attributes these changing conditions partly to anthropogenic climate change that has brought increased temperatures and reduced cool season rainfall, while acknowledging other causes, including El-Nino Southern Oscillation variation.",

It shows that for the wildfires in the western US in 2014, no link to climate change could be detected, but the overall probability of wildfires has increased due to human-induced climate change in that region.",

Climate drivers alone contribute to an increase in burned area, while humans suppress fires globally but with notable regional variability.",
